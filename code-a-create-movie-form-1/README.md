# Code a Create Movie Form

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, let's give users the ability to add new movies in the Movie Rating App. 

## Requirements
- Create an "Add Movie" button
- Show a form for creating new movies when the button is clicked
- Include the following fields on the form:
  - Name: text input & required
  - Description: textarea
  - Image: text input
  - Genre: dropdown & required & user can select multiple
  - Is in theaters: checkbox 
- Validate the form on submit
- Once submitted and valid, add the movie to the list
- Clear and hide the form after the movie is added
- Add a cancel button to the form
  - Clicking the cancel button should clean up the form, and any error that it might have.
  - Clicking the cancel button should hide the form for the user.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can make up any genres you like

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can visit [imdb.com](https://imdb.com) to find movie descriptions, images, etc for testing your form

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.

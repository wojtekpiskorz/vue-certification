- The rating of each movie should starts with a `null` value.
- The computed property named `computedMovies` returns the `movies`, adding a `notRated` value to each movie if it was rated or not.
- Based on the `notRated` value property the text color of the `#rating` element changes from `text-yellow-500` if `true`, to`text-gray-500` if `false`.
- The `#rating-stars` element only shows if the movie was rated.
